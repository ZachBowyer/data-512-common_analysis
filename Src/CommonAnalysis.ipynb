    "# Description\n",
    "This notebook attempts to answer the question:\n",
    "\"What are the estimated smoke impacts on Leavenworth, Kansas for the last 60 years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, multiple main actions are done:\n",
    "1. Read wildfire GEOJson data\n",
    "2. Calculate distance from all wildfires to Leavenworth, Kansas by averaging ring distance.\n",
    "3. Save immediate results to new file\n",
    "4. Get the subset of all fires with in 1250 miles of Leavenworth, Kansas\n",
    "5. Create an annual smoke estimate\n",
    "6. Get monthly AQI estimates for Leavenworth Kansas by combining the nearest four station particulate data. \n",
    "7. Create linear regression model to predict the annual smoke estimate, and create ARIMA model to forecast the annual smoke estimate to 2049.\n",
    "8. Create histogram visualization showing the number of fires occuring every 50 miles from Leavenworth up to 1250 miles.\n",
    "9. Create time series showing annual acres burned by wildfires with in 1250 miles of Leavenworth.\n",
    "10. Create time series showing smoke estimate, create time series showing AQI estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Warnings:\n",
    "1. Since file sizes are ~3gb, you may run out of memory, especially if you have many duplicates of the same data. This is why we attempt to clear up memory at times.  \n"

    "# 5. Create an annual smoke estimate\n",
    "The estimate for annual smoke that I came up with is very simple. \n",
    "In this estimate I try to incorporate the volume of smoke burned by wood, the amount of \n",
    "wood burned, and the distance from the wildfire to Leavenworth. \n",
    "Unfortunately, this estimate is probably very inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: Smoke_impact_from_fire = (area_forest_burned * 10 * 87.5) / (distance_from_city^5)\n",
    "To get the annual smoke estimate, we sum the smoke_impact_from_fire over every fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions made:\n",
    "1. The volume of smoke produced by wood is 87.5 M^2 per kg. \n",
    "http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html#:~:text=In%20well%20ventilated%20conditions%2C%20the,the%20smoke%20production%20of%20wood.  \n",
    "2. There is 10 kilograms of wood on average per square meter in a forest. (No source)\n",
    "3. Smoke dispersion is inversely proportional to the distance to the fifth power. (Did this to keep relative scale low)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons this estimate is bad:\n",
    "1. The volume of smoke produced by wood depends on the type of tree.\n",
    "2. More than just wood burns in a wildfire. \n",
    "3. The amount of wood on average per square meter in a forest varies on the type of flora present, the season, and other various factors.\n",
    "4. Smoke dispersion is much more complicated than what I have proposed. There have been many studies on atmospheric transport models, which are much better estimates than what we have. However data for atmospheric transport models probably does not exist for our data (especially for the old stuff). \n",
    "5. Other factors that I'm not aware of\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Notes:  \n",
    "Overall, I decided the smoke estimate should be summed during the year because data is sparse. This means if we were to use a finer time scale we would end up with a lot of missing data that we would either have to set as an average or 0 in order to do time-series analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did not see a reason to only use wildfires from the fire season, as smoke can effect a city at any time of the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "I looked for sources talking about the amount of wood per square meter in a forest but could not find anything. Therefore I arbitrarily picked a number, as the amount of smoke would scale linearly, so in terms of tracking relative change it wouldn't affect much. "
